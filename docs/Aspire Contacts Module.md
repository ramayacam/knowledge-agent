## Overview

In Aspire, a **property** is a location where your company performs work. Properties are the foundation of the CRM — they're where you create Opportunities, estimate work, track activity, and manage client relationships.

The Properties module shows a list of all properties in your system. Use filters, sorts, groups, and saved searches to organize the list.

- Click the **three-dot menu** to create a new Issue, Task, Email, or Appointment for the property.
- Click **New Property** to add a new property.
