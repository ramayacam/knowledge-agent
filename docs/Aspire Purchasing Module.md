## How to Build a Saved List

1. Navigate to the module (Activities, Properties, Work Tickets, etc.).
2. Use **Advanced Search Tools** to set filters, display fields, sort, and group.
3. Click the **three-dot menu → Save As** to save the list.

## Pivot Reports

Pivot Reports give you flexible multi-dimensional analysis. Available pivot types:

- **Sales Pivot** – analyze opportunities by sales rep, division, status, month

- **Hours Pivot** – analyze labor hours for payroll and efficiency

| **Row Display Fields** | What the rows represent (e.g., Division, Property, Employee) |
| **Column Display Fields** | What the columns represent (usually a time period like Month) |
| **Filter Fields** | Narrow results by date, division, status, etc. |

The **Web Report Designer** is a tool for customizing the printable report layouts used throughout Aspire (invoices, proposals, work tickets, etc.).

### Required Permission

### Access
**Administration → Application → Web Report Designer**

### Customizable Report Types (16 total)

| Report Type | Location |

### Key Concepts

**Report Bands** define sections of the report layout:
- **ReportHeader** – Appears once at the start of the report (cover page, logo)
- **PageHeader** – Appears at the top of every page (column headers, page numbers)
- **GroupHeader** – Appears at the start of each data group. Controls grouping logic.
- **DetailBand** – Displays one record at a time from the data source
- **GroupFooter** – Appears at the end of each group (subtotals)
- **ReportFooter** – Appears once at the end (totals, signatures)
- **PageFooter** – Appears at the bottom of every page

**Calculated Fields** let you create custom expressions using data fields, math operators, and functions.

**Formatting Rules** apply conditional formatting (show/hide, color changes) based on True/False conditions.

**Data Members** are the datasets pulled from Aspire. Each report type has its own set of available fields.

### Saving Reports

| Method | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Save (same version)** | Minor changes — Unpublish, edit, then Publish. Previous state is lost. |
| **Save As (new version)** | Major changes — creates a new version you can revert to if needed. |
| **Save As (copy)** | Duplicating a report layout as a starting point for a new one. |

> Use **Administration → Set Up Report Layout Defaults** to control which version of a report is used for each report type.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between a saved list and a report?**
A saved list is a filtered, sortable view within a module. A report (in the Reports module) is a printable or pivot-based output designed for deeper analysis.

Yes. From any list, go to the three-dot menu and choose **Export to Excel (Current View)** or **Export to Excel (All Fields)**.
